# AI Instructions for AuthApp Project

This document provides guidelines for AI assistants working on the AuthApp project. Follow these instructions to maintain consistency and adhere to the project's architecture and best practices.

## Project Architecture

1. Modular Structure
   - The project is organized into modules under `src/modules/`
   - Each module (e.g., auth, dashboard) contains its own components, views, and API logic

2. No API Routes
   - Use Next.js server actions instead of traditional API routes
   - Server actions should be placed in `src/modules/[module]/api/mutations/` or `src/modules/[module]/api/queries/`

3. Database (Drizzle ORM with SQLite)
   - Main schema is defined in `src/server/db/schema/index.ts`
   - Module-specific schemas go in `src/modules/[module]/api/schemas/`
   - Use Drizzle's migration tools for schema changes

4. Authentication
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Session management using HTTP-only cookies
   - Support for email/password and GitHub OAuth

## Coding Standards

1. Use TypeScript for all new code
2. Follow the existing code style and formatting
3. Use meaningful variable and function names
4. Keep components and functions small and focused
5. Use server actions for API functionality instead of API routes
6. Implement proper error handling and input validation
