# Analytics Features Overview

## Core Features

### 1. Site Visit Tracking

- Track total site visits
- Track total individual page visits
- Differentiate between unique visitors and recurring visitors

### 2. Visitor Metrics

- Capture timestamps
- Collect geodata
- Identify device type (mobile or desktop)
- Record operating system
- Log user language

### 3. Session Information

- Track session duration
- Identify entry pages
- Determine if visit is organic or from a referral source
- If referral, log the source

### 4. Exit Analysis

- Record exit pages
- For premature exits during page loads, log what was loading

### 5. Authenticated User Tracking

- Log all steps for authenticated users
- Record registration actions
- Track login actions and frequency
- Log average visit duration for authenticated users
- Store last visit timestamp/date
- Log errors encountered by users, including location/context

## Implementation Guidelines

- No API routes
- Use mutations and queries only
- Co-locate all code in a modules directory
- Server-side rendering (SSR) focus using Next.js
- Minimize client-side hooks where possible

## File Naming Convention

Use kebab-case for filenames. Examples:

- `site-visit-tracker.ts`
- `user-session-logger.ts`
- `authenticated-user-analytics.ts`

## Documentation

Use JSDoc for important business logic, including @author and @description. Example:

```typescript
/**
 * @author [Your Name]
 * @description Records a site visit with associated metadata
 */
```
