## Integration Guidelines

When using these references:

1. **Maintain Architecture**: Ensure any integrated components follow our modular architecture and separation of concerns.
2. **Custom Implementation**: Use these as references to build our own custom solutions rather than direct imports where possible.
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with our existing UI components and design system.
4. **Dependencies**: Minimize additional dependencies when implementing features inspired by these references.

## Additional Notes

- All integrations should be reviewed against our core architectural principles
- Custom implementations are preferred over direct third-party solutions
- Ensure proper testing and documentation when implementing features based on these references
