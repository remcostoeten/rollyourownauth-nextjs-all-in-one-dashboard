# Activity Logs: Concept and Architecture Overview

## System Goals

1. Track user actions and content interactions
2. Monitor system performance and errors
3. Provide insights through an admin dashboard
4. Ensure data privacy and GDPR compliance

## Architecture Overview

Our activity logging system will be built using the following technologies and practices:

- Next.js 15 for the web application framework
- React 19 for the user interface
- Drizzle ORM with SQLite for data storage
- Server Actions for handling log entries
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO

## Key Components

1. **Logging Service**: A server-side service that handles log entry creation and storage.
2. **Client-Side Logger**: A lightweight client-side module that sends log data to the server.
3. **Admin Dashboard**: A server-rendered page for viewing and analyzing log data.
4. **Database**: SQLite database managed by Drizzle ORM for storing log entries.

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the application
2. Client-side logger captures the interaction
3. Log data is sent to the server via a Server Action
4. Server Action processes and stores the log entry in the database
5. Admin can view and analyze log data through the dashboard
